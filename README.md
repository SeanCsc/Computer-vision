# Computer-vision

## Computer Vision Course

### Image alignment and color reconstruction: implement different interpolation method to reconstruct RGB image.

### Photometric Stereo: based on pictures from different light view, reconstruct 3D figure of human face.

### Scale-space blob detection: Implement Laplacian filter to detect blob. Through changing the filter size and image size, detect the possible location and size of blob. Implement maximum compression for the blobs.

### mage stiching: By implementing feature detection (corner), feature description, and RANSAC to get the transformation matrix and then stich two or three figures.
